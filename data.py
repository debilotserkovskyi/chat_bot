*INGREDIENTS*
Rice – We recommend koshihikari rice for the best texture. Cook it in a rice cooker, a multi-cooker,
or on the stove using the absorption method. Here’s a great guide on how to cook Japanese sushi rice.
Furikake – This is a type of Japanese seasoning usually sprinkled over cooked rice. It’s made from a blend of
ingredients like dried bonito flakes, sesame seeds, seaweed, egg, salt, sugar and various spices.
There are so many furikake flavours out there, so look for packets of assorted furikake flavours and
experiment to find your favourite! You can get them from your nearby Asian grocer or online, or even make your own.
We’ve also included some optional ideas below to customise your onigiri with different seasonings and fillings.
You can buy the furikake pictured below online here.
Nori – This is the flat seaweed wrapper also used to wrap sushi. You can find it online, at Asian grocers or even
from well stocked supermarkets either in full size squares or in mini pre-cut strips. It’s not essential,
but does make for a great little hand hold for your homemade onigiri.""",

STEP 1
Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly.
Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.
STEP 2
Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt.
This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.
STEP 3
Take up one portion of rice in your hands.
STEP 4
If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent,
place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.
STEP 5
Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze
the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so it’s even.
STEP 6
Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri (the rough side should face the rice)
and fold it up towards to the middle of the onigiri.

Rice – We recommend koshihikari rice for the best texture. Cook it in a rice cooker, a multi-cooker,
or on the stove using the absorption method. Here’s a great guide on how to cook Japanese sushi rice.
Furikake – This is a type of Japanese seasoning usually sprinkled over cooked rice. It’s made from a blend of
ingredients like dried bonito flakes, sesame seeds, seaweed, egg, salt, sugar and various spices.
There are so many furikake flavours out there, so look for packets of assorted furikake flavours and
experiment to find your favourite! You can get them from your nearby Asian grocer or online, or even make your own.
We’ve also included some optional ideas below to customise your onigiri with different seasonings and fillings.
You can buy the furikake pictured below online here.
Nori – This is the flat seaweed wrapper also used to wrap sushi. You can find it online, at Asian grocers or even
from well stocked supermarkets either in full size squares or in mini pre-cut strips. It’s not essential,
but does make for a great little hand hold for your homemade onigiri.""",

Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze
the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so it’s even.

*INGREDIENTS*
Rice – We recommend koshihikari rice for the best texture. Cook it in a rice cooker, a multi-cooker,
or on the stove using the absorption method. Here’s a great guide on how to cook Japanese sushi rice.
Furikake – This is a type of Japanese seasoning usually sprinkled over cooked rice. It’s made from a blend of
ingredients like dried bonito flakes, sesame seeds, seaweed, egg, salt, sugar and various spices.
There are so many furikake flavours out there, so look for packets of assorted furikake flavours and
experiment to find your favourite! You can get them from your nearby Asian grocer or online, or even make your own.
We’ve also included some optional ideas below to customise your onigiri with different seasonings and fillings.
You can buy the furikake pictured below online here.
Nori – This is the flat seaweed wrapper also used to wrap sushi. You can find it online, at Asian grocers or even
from well stocked supermarkets either in full size squares or in mini pre-cut strips. It’s not essential,
but does make for a great little hand hold for your homemade onigiri.""",

STEP 1
Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly.
Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.
STEP 2
Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt.
This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.
STEP 3
Take up one portion of rice in your hands.
STEP 4
If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent,
place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.
STEP 5
Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze
the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so it’s even.
STEP 6
Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri (the rough side should face the rice)
and fold it up towards to the middle of the onigiri.

STEP 1
Add 15g (1¼ cups) of katsuobushi, 3 tbsp tsuyu sauce and 1 tbsp white sesame seeds to a large bowl and mix.

STEP 2
Once all the liquid is absorbed, add 600g (3 cups) of cooked rice to the bowl.

STEP 3
Mix well until all of the ingredients are spread evenly through the rice.

STEP 4
Divide the rice into 4-6 portions (depending on how big you want the onigiri to be).

STEP 5
Prepare a bowl of ice cold water and a small bowl with 1 tbsp salt.

STEP 6
Wash your hands well and then submerge them into the bowl of icy cold water for about 15-20 seconds.
This stops the rice sticking to your hands. (See note if you don't want to handle the rice)

STEP 7
Rub 1-2 pinches of salt over the palms your hands. This not only adds the flavour to the rice ball,
but also acts as a preservative whilst it’s in your lunchbox.

STEP 8
Take a handful of the rice mixture and start to shape it in your palms, pressing the edges to form a triangle shape.
If you press and turn, press and turn, press and turn, you should make a good firm triangle shape.

STEP 9
Don’t handle the rice for too long, quicker is better. Once you’re happy with the shape, wrap it with nori.

STEP 10
Put your hands back in the icy water and repeat. This recipe makes 4-6 rice balls (depending on size).

STEP 11
Eat straight away or put in your lunch box with an ice pack. They’re best eaten the same day.

STEP 12

Rice – We recommend koshihikari rice for the best texture. Cook it in a rice cooker, a multi-cooker,
or on the stove using the absorption method. Here’s a great guide on how to cook Japanese sushi rice.
Furikake – This is a type of Japanese seasoning usually sprinkled over cooked rice. It’s made from a blend of
ingredients like dried bonito flakes, sesame seeds, seaweed, egg, salt, sugar and various spices.
There are so many furikake flavours out there, so look for packets of assorted furikake flavours and
experiment to find your favourite! You can get them from your nearby Asian grocer or online, or even make your own.
We’ve also included some optional ideas below to customise your onigiri with different seasonings and fillings.
You can buy the furikake pictured below online here.
Nori – This is the flat seaweed wrapper also used to wrap sushi. You can find it online, at Asian grocers or even
from well stocked supermarkets either in full size squares or in mini pre-cut strips. It’s not essential,
but does make for a great little hand hold for your homemade onigiri.""",

Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze
the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so it’s even.

Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri (the rough side should face the rice)

Pour a quarter cup of water around the dumplings. Be careful not to pour water directly on them.

STEP 6
Cover the pan and allow the gyoza to fully cook in the steam.
The dumplings are done with the water has evaporated and you can hear the oil start to sizzle.

STEP 7
Stir the water-starch solution before pouring it around the edges of the pan.

STEP 8
Cover the pan once more and cook the gyoza until the water-starch solution has solidified and "wings"
have formed between the dumplings.

STEP 9
Drizzle the remaining tablespoon of sesame seed oil along the outer edges of the "wings" for extra crisp.
If you can manage to partially lift the gyoza to allow the oil to get to spread underneath, so much the better.
When the oil sizzles, the gyoza with wings are done.


STEP 10
Position a plate upside down over the pan then invert the gyoza on the plate.

STEP 11
Use chopsticks to break the "wings" between the dumplings before picking up a piece."""

15g / 1¼ cups Katsuobushi (Bonito Flakes)
3 tbsp Tsuyu Sauce (see how to make your own tsuyu here.)
1 tbsp White Sesame Seeds

*SHAPING*
1 bowl of ice cold water
1 tbsp salt

STEP 1
Add 15g (1¼ cups) of katsuobushi, 3 tbsp tsuyu sauce and 1 tbsp white sesame seeds to a large bowl and mix.

STEP 2
Once all the liquid is absorbed, add 600g (3 cups) of cooked rice to the bowl.

STEP 3
Mix well until all of the ingredients are spread evenly through the rice.

STEP 4
Divide the rice into 4-6 portions (depending on how big you want the onigiri to be).

STEP 5
Prepare a bowl of ice cold water and a small bowl with 1 tbsp salt.

STEP 6
Wash your hands well and then submerge them into the bowl of icy cold water for about 15-20 seconds.
This stops the rice sticking to your hands. (See note if you don't want to handle the rice)

STEP 7
Rub 1-2 pinches of salt over the palms your hands. This not only adds the flavour to the rice ball,
but also acts as a preservative whilst it’s in your lunchbox.

STEP 8
Take a handful of the rice mixture and start to shape it in your palms, pressing the edges to form a triangle shape.
If you press and turn, press and turn, press and turn, you should make a good firm triangle shape.

STEP 9
Don’t handle the rice for too long, quicker is better. Once you’re happy with the shape, wrap it with nori.

STEP 10
Put your hands back in the icy water and repeat. This recipe makes 4-6 rice balls (depending on size).

STEP 11
Eat straight away or put in your lunch box with an ice pack. They’re best eaten the same day.
